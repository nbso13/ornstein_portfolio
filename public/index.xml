      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello World! I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in a Pret in Paris right now, having just finished Paul Auster&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;(fantastic)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Trilogy&lt;/em&gt;, putting together some thoughts on where I&amp;rsquo;ve been and where I want to go professionally, as a bit of an introduction to this portfolio website in the making. Here goes nothing:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After school at UChicago (see some other blog post for thoughts on those experiences), hoping to continue to build my research chops and learn more about my family&amp;rsquo;s life in Europe post-war as survivors, I earned a Fulbright  and moved to Munich Germany. On the research side, I worked in Professor Albrecht Schmidt&amp;rsquo;s lab under Professor Lewis Chuang. I learned how to write clean research code, build and test an HCI artifact (EMS system for rhythm learning), and fit into an interdisciplinary research group. On the cultural side, I learned some basic German and joined a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/yudid_official/&#34;&gt;funk and soul band&lt;/a&gt; as a keyboardist and vocalist, and started to play gigs around the city&amp;ndash;highlights included Bahnw√§rter Thiel, the Lost Weekend, Killian&amp;rsquo;s, Kennedy&amp;rsquo;s, and Minna Thiel. I also explored my family&amp;rsquo;s history in Szendro, Hungary - read more about that project in another blog post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
