   I'm a civic technologist and with a background in analytics and neuroscience, 
   looking for analyst jobs at non-profits and progressive political organizations. 
   I just finished a job at Amazon Ads, before which I worked as a Fulbright Scholar in 
   Dr. Albrecht Schmidt's  <a target='lab' href='https://www.um.informatik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html'>lab</a> 
   at the LMU Munich under Dr. Lewis Chuang. I'm also an indie rock singer-songwriter trained on jazz keys.

  title: "Bio"
  content: >
    <p class="lead">
      I was born and grew up outside Boston, MA, and completed my BSc. in Neuroscience at the University of Chicago in 2021.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
      After school, hoping to continue to build my research chops and learn more 
      about my family's life in Europe post-war as survivors, I earned a Fulbright 
      and moved to Munich Germany. On the research side, I worked in Professor Albrecht Schmidt's 
      lab under Professor Lewis Chuang. I then did some data work on a Texas House campaign via 
      Bluebonnet Data back stateside, before starting a Data Analyst role at Amazon Germany in December 2022.
      In July 2024, I decided I was ready to explore new opportunities and prepare to apply to graduate programs,
      and moved back to the Boston area.
