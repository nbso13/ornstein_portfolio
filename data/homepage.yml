  title: "Hi!"
  content: >
    <p class="lead">
    I'm Nick, a researcher/data analyst/civic technologist with a background in neuroscience and human-computer interaction. 
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
    My research interests lie in computational social science, specifically, the use of network science
      to study online communities, misinformation, and political communication.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
    My undergrad research was in computational neuroscience, studying texture perception at UChicago's Bensmaia Lab. 
    After school, I moved to Munich on a Fulbright, working under Professors Lewis Chuang and Albrecht Schmidt at LMU Munich 
    on electrical muscle stimulation for rhythm learning. After my Fulbright ended, I joined Amazon Germany as a Data Analyst.
    I moved back stateside in 2024 to help out on the election, cutting turf, routing canvassers, and automating processes for
    the Tester campaign for the Montana Senate seat. In January 2025, I will start as an Analyst at Eastern Research Group, working on
    software, UI design, and analysis projects for the EPA and other federal clients. You can find me on the 
    <a href="https://x.com/OrnsteinNick">platform formerly known as Twitter</a> or on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nickornstein.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>.
