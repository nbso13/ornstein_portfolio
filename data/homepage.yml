   I'm a civic technologist and with a background in analytics and neuroscience, 
   looking for analyst jobs at non-profits and progressive political organizations. 
   I just finished a job at Amazon Ads, before which I worked as a Fulbright Scholar in 
   Dr. Albrecht Schmidt's  <a target='lab' href='https://www.um.informatik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html'>lab</a> 
   at the LMU Munich under Dr. Lewis Chuang. I'm also an indie rock singer-songwriter trained on jazz keys.

  title: "Bio"
  content: >
    <p class="lead">
      I was born and grew up outside Boston, MA, and completed my BSc. in Neuroscience at the University of Chicago in 2021.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
      After school, hoping to continue to build my research chops and learn more 
      about my family's life in Europe post-war as survivors, I earned a Fulbright 
      and moved to Munich Germany. On the research side, I worked in Professor Albrecht Schmidt's 
      lab under Professor Lewis Chuang. I learned how to write clean research code,
      build and test an HCI artifact (EMS system for rhythm learning), and fit into an interdisciplinary research group.
      On the cultural side, I learned some basic German and joined a 
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yudid_official/">funk and soul band</a> as a keyboardist and vocalist,
      and started to play gigs around the city--highlights included Bahnwärter Thiel, 
      the Lost Weekend, Killian's, Kennedy's, and Minna Thiel. 
      </p>
     <p class="lead">
      In the mean time, my Fulbright year ended and it was time
      to think about my expiring visa and my next role. Deciding to commit to more time in Europe, I accepted an offer at Amazon Ads
      as a Data Analyst at Amazon Ads. Unfortunately, I was hit with months of visa processing delay.
      I took the time to participate in the 2022 election, working remotely on Coach Cam Campbell's campaign
      for Texas House district 132, using <a href="https://github.com/nbso13/texas_hd132_district_report">voter data I analyzed in GeoPandas to provide recommendations</a> voter data I analyzed in GeoPandas to provide recommendations
      on which census tracts were most important for turning out key voters in the election.
      Finally, I began my time at Amazon back in Munich. In my time as a data analyst, I 
      honed my craft in SQL, Python, and AWS technologies. I learned a ton--how to build a clean slide deck,
      how to present to C-suite execs, how to ask for help from the experts in my org, how to automate complicated tasks,
      how to work on a remote and international team, how to prioritze tasks and say no to spillover requests.
      At about a year and a half into the job, I accepted that while every other part of work was ideal (colleagues,
      challenge, learning, comp, location, chance for promotion, life balance, etc.) I was hung up on the final output
      of my work - that I was helping to optimize advertisements for maximum effect (return for advertisers). There
      are more detrimental lines of work for sure, but I felt the net impact of what I was doing was none, or perhaps,
      slightly negative (Joe Schmo buys what he otherwise would not have). I learned a healthy respect for the power
      of advertising at scale. Subtle exposure can indeed change behavior. Groups of humans, if not predictable, become more 
      predictable than individuals, to the point where you can know them and even shift decision outcomes. This line
      of behavior economics thinking is nothing new if you're familiar with Thaler, Sunstein, and the late 'n great 
      Kahneman and Tversky. But watching it play out in real time, and having a hand in it (however small), gave me
      more of a Zuboff, surveillance capitalism feeling.
    </p>
     <p class="lead">
      So my next career move, whatever it will be, will have to have some net positive downstream impact. That could be
      fixing problems in the health care industry, modeling energy markets to suggest more efficient and equitable policies,
      helping to elect progressives, or working as an analyst in the office of an attorney general. We'll see what works out.
      Wherever I do end up, I will certainly bring with me a deeper understanding of and curiousity for the power held by these
      large corporations that monetize the data of their millions (billions) of users. As LLMs give good text generation capability
      to the internet Everyman, and companies craft increasingly capable automated agents, there will no doubt be changes
      to human behavior on the internet, with impacts across the board (e-commerce, government, journalism, influence campaigns, etc).
      In the longer arc of my career, I want to continue to study these phenomena with a mind toward the role of the government
      in regulating behavior modification at scale.
