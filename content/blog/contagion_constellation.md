You might be wondering what that funky viz is doing on my home page. I'm a fan of funky interactive web designs so I pulled in some p5.js and (with the help of ChatGPT) crafted this fun little dot dance thing. It gels with my interest in network science, and I think it looks nice. The rules are essentially that the dots spawn in pastel colors and randomly move about the screen. When close enough to another dot, a line is drawn between the two. If your mouse is within a given radius to a dot, the dot is attracted to your mouse, and infected by the disruptive presence of your cursor, turning red. When a dot comes close enough to draw a line to another dot, and one is red, the other becomes red too. After 1.5 seconds of being red and not coming into contact with another dot, the dot will 'heal' and return to its original pastel shade. 

Perhaps its a metaphor for how our innocent observation of a system can change it in a sudden cascade: when the site loads and you don't even know the rules, you'll have already begun to spread the red (as it were) by just moving your mouse. But the system also has the capacity to heal as the dots return to their original color. Even so, once the change has been made, there will always be clusters of red dots hanging round, and the virus is unlikely to ever be stamped out due to the crowded homepage conditions. The changing colors and the abstract line drawings that arise inspired the title 'Contagion Constellation'.

Or maybe it's not that deep! And possibly it's too busy. Strong opinion? You can reach out and let me know if you feel so moved.
