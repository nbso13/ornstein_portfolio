Flitting from flowers,   
All tottering.   
Bozen to Bolzano,   
Your boot soul licking   
Alpine dirt and tarmac,   
To sweet sea air:   
Heart strings all strung out   
On a last love and a final destination.   

Known only in the knees,   
Born always in the eyes,   
Pulling you out and   
Splintering the oldest tether:   
From the belly’s core   
To the mother’s bloodstream,   
All flung, maybe fleeing,   
From heights to valley   
With the floodwaters.   

Neither leading    
Nor being chased    
(Neither consummating   
Nor abstaining),   
Bound with rubber bands   
To the iron post   
At the tunnel’s mouth.   
Whisper to the next traveler   
The gibberish recipe   
You chant like a verse   
And sing like a warning.   

Sweat we shed,   
Tears we whip away,   
Mingling with the raindrops   
Gathering in the depths of the valley.   
Will it dissolve the bonds   
At the post at the mouth   
Of the tunnel, or drown   
The whisperer?
