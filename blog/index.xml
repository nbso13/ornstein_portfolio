All tottering.&lt;br>
Bozen to Bolzano,&lt;br>
Your boot soul licking&lt;br>
Alpine dirt and tarmac,&lt;br>
To sweet sea air:&lt;br>
Heart strings all strung out&lt;br>
On a last love and a final destination.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Known only in the knees,&lt;br>
Born always in the eyes,&lt;br>
Pulling you out and&lt;br>
Splintering the oldest tether:&lt;br>
From the belly’s core&lt;br>
To the mother’s bloodstream,&lt;br>
All flung, maybe fleeing,&lt;br>
From heights to valley&lt;br>
With the floodwaters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World! New website, new me.</title><link>https://nicholasornstein.com/blog/hello_world/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2024 14:38:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://nicholasornstein.com/blog/hello_world/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello World! I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in a Pret in Paris right now, having just finished Paul Auster&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong>(fantastic)&lt;/strong> &lt;em>New York Trilogy&lt;/em>, putting together some thoughts on where I&amp;rsquo;ve been and where I want to go professionally, as a bit of an introduction to this portfolio website in the making. Here goes nothing:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After school at UChicago (see some other blog post for thoughts on those experiences), hoping to continue to build my research chops and learn more about my family&amp;rsquo;s life in Europe post-war as survivors, I earned a Fulbright and moved to Munich Germany. On the research side, I worked in Professor Albrecht Schmidt&amp;rsquo;s lab under Professor Lewis Chuang. I learned how to write clean research code, build and test an HCI artifact (EMS system for rhythm learning), and fit into an interdisciplinary research group. On the cultural side, I learned some basic German and joined a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/yudid_official/">funk and soul band&lt;/a> as a keyboardist and vocalist, and started to play gigs around the city&amp;ndash;highlights included Bahnwärter Thiel, the Lost Weekend, Killian&amp;rsquo;s, Kennedy&amp;rsquo;s, and Minna Thiel. I also explored my family&amp;rsquo;s history in Szendro, Hungary - read more about that project in another blog post.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unreal September</title><link>https://nicholasornstein.com/blog/dr_smile/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nicholasornstein.com/blog/dr_smile/</guid><description>&lt;p>Unreal September&lt;br>
Money leaks&lt;br>
Into quiche&lt;br>
Speckled and potato.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please turn up the bass,&lt;br>
Please keep the time,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A child’s particle dream,&lt;br>
Narrated in subway tones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Best product, &lt;br>
festival cheese:&lt;br>
Dry euro:&lt;br>
We exhaled: gaps&lt;br>
In the night tracks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dr. Smile’s favorite&lt;br>
Kneesling can hold&lt;br>
Fearsome knees and&lt;br>
75 years of fellowship and&lt;br>
the apathy drawn from&lt;br>
A raw persimmon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, consume,&lt;br>
Only in preparation.&lt;br>
Henceforth, thrice&lt;br>
Daily, be reminded:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
